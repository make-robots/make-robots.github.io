3d Printing
=========

This section is dedicated to all things 3d printing. This is not all inclusive but can be used as references. 


Is 3d Printing for me?
================
This is a question I get asked often. My answer isn't simple and I've dedicated an entire blog post to it.  Please see it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-01-Is-3d-Printing-For-Me %}

3d Printers
==========

There are many, many, many 3d printers available for purchase. This is not a comprehensive list of 3d printers. This list are ones which are typically high rated for consumer use. This list is for FTM printers. 

**I do not recommend any newcomer purchase a cheap Chinese printer because they generally use lower quality parts and/or poor assembly.**

* [Prusa 3d](https://www.prusa3d.com/) - Most consider Prusa to be a leader in 3d printers. In fact, most FTM printers are based on Prusa's designs. Which can lead to some confusion. Prusa has made all designs opensource which allows anyone to replicate, however, there's no guarantee on quality of parts used by the replicas. You can get a fully assembled printer for under $1000USD (before shipping) and a can't for $749 USD(before shipping).
* [Lulzbot](https://www.lulzbot.com/) - Another open source hardware company. The Lulzbots have the Taz line of printers. These are more expensive than Prusa's and use the growingly less popular 2.85mm filaments. However, I own a Taz 5 and love it. The build volume on it is great.
* [Ultimaker 3](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-3) - Not opensource like the above options and the price tag is greater than the Taz 6 but does have some nice bells and whistles. 
* Many more.........

Filament
=======

FTM printers need filament. This is usually (but definitely not always) plastic that has been extruded into a string and rolled up. There are non-plastic options and infused plastic options. 

There are not standards for filaments. Which means there are no color standards, material standards, quality control standards. The only quality even remotely a standard is the filament diameter. 1.75mm and 2.85/3.00mm. (Did I mention that almost everything in 3d printing is in metric?) But even that has variances.

Common Filaments
==========

This list used to be short but now there's so many different varieties now that this gets to be complicated.

* PLA
* ABS
* PET
* PETG
* Flex
* Nylon
* Glass
* Wood
* Carbon Fiber

Each type of filament has advantages and disadvantages. Many common consumer grade printers can't handle ABS. At least not without an enclosure. Other filaments require a hardened nozzle as they are abrasive and will erode the nozzle overtime.  Some filaments require a headed bed and others are just fine without.
