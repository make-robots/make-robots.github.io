## Welcome to make-robots.org

March 11, 2018 - I am building this site to provide information on my own robot designs, links to other interesting/useful robot designs, and resources for others.

I don't expect to have this site overly populated right away. It will probably take a few months to get all the content in place. Please check back often.

I plan on adding social media accounts to easily follow this site.

I aim for this to be in a hybrid of a blog format along with a resource library.
