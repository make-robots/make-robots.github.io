Is 3d Printing For Me?
==========

When I have conversations with people about what I do the topic of 3d Printing comes up.  This almost always leads into the topic of whether the person I am talking to could benefit from a 3d printer. I don't have a canned response and usually it ends up being a long conversation. I'm dedicating this post to the topic.

There are proponents of 3d printers out there who believe that there will be a day when every home will have a 3d printer.  I am a proponent of 3d printing and I think one day this will be the case, but I don't see it within the next 10 years. My reasoning will be covered throughout this post.

First thing to consider is cost. To purchase a 3d printer which the average Joe user could operate isn't cheap. These are typically $1000 USD or more. The $1000 printers are good but most still have a learning curve.  There's also the cost of filament. Good filament costs more than $25 for 1 KG (2.2lbs for those still on imperial system) and that is for the low end of good. Higher quality nearly doubles that price and goes up from there. 

There are kits available which can lower the cost but do require technical skills to assemble.

One of the biggest factors in cost of filament is waste. Waste is the filament costs can be nearly that of the cost of the filament used in the final part. Prints fail quite often for beginners unfortunately.  I can remember my early days of 3d printing. It wasn't unusual for me to end up with 10 or more failed prints. Some would fail early but others would fail nearly halfway through. That wasted a lot of filament. Now I'm more skilled and have fewer failed prints but it still happens. 

Then there's the issue of what to print. Most average Joe users are not familiar with CAD software and the learning curve on CAD software is higher than that of using a word processor.  Fortunately Tinkercad and Fusion 360 (both backed by Autodesk) are helping out newcomers. 

Fortunately you don't have to create your own files. There are sites dedicated to sharing designs which makes it easy for a newcomer to get started. 

One day businesses could potentially just post design files and a customer could print the product. This has a lot of potential and I'm starting to see this concept budding (MRRF 2018 had an example from the guys at E3D). 

Do you have a need for one? Are you into arts and crafts? Would being able to build plastic parts assist in a hobby? If so then yes you probably should get a 3d printer.

Now let's get down to business. The average consumer will be timid about purchasing a 3d printer for $1000 or more. They may look around and find some of the cheap Chinese 3d printers which can be purchased for under $200. That's pretty cheap and unfortunately they may not realize they are getting cheap. Knock off designs from the higher end printers mass produced with extremely cheap parts. There have been fires caused by this. Search YouTube and Google for electrical issues with 3d printers and you'll find plenty of examples. Some of these have underrated wiring/components which cause electrical (FIRE) issues. This unfortunately can give the 3d printing community a bad reputation and will unfortunately lead to regulations in the US and other countries I'm sure once a child is burned to death by one of these cheap Chinese printers. If you don't know electronics, and don't have the ability the knowledge of what to look for related to electrical safety I strongly discourage you from buying a cheap 3d printer from China (and often they are sold via Amazon to help hide their cheap Chinese origins). 

**I say again, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP CHINESE 3D PRINTER UNLESS YOU ARE EXPERIENCED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH ELECTRONICS!**

Let's sum this up:

Is 3d printing for me?

* Yes, if you have the technical skills to build a 3d printer from a kit
* Yes, if you have the technical skills to diagnose electrical issues (if you buy a cheap printer)
* Yes, if you have the funds to buy a good consumer grade printer.
* Yes, if you have a need for one.
* No, if you're just an average Joe consumer with no real need to fabricate plastic parts at home. If you have a need for a single plastic part there are 3d printing hubs out there where you can connect with a service to print your parts.
