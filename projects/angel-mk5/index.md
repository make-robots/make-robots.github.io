Angel MK5
=========

The Angel Mk5 is my code name for a robotics project I've been dreaming about all my life. Well not all my life, but since around the mid-late 1980s.

This robot is inspired by a movie robot but it isn't a replica. While I openly admit it resembles the movie character it differs in a few ways

 * It isn't alive
 * It isn't a military robot
 * It isn't identical

This robot, along with all the rest of my projects will be open source. The design files, STL files, BoM, and instructions will be freely available. 

This robot is currently being designed and built. Progress will be tracked here, github, and our YouTube Channel.

**Disclaimer**: Yes this robot resembles a movie robot but it isn't in any way intended as 1 for 1 replica. There are also other individuals and groups of enthusiasts on the Internet who have built or building movie accurate replicas. I've reviewed some of those projects and they are definitely impressive but they do tend to lack structure, organization, and openness. This robot is designed entirely from scratch with inspiration coming from watching movies.
